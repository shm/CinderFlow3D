CinderFlow 3D
=============

Emitters & particles in a 3D World.
Based on "cinderflow" (https://github.com/hpeikemo/CinderFlow) by @hpeikemo & the cinder "flocking" tutorial.

Made with cinder http://libcinder.org/.

About
-----
Dummy project to refresh my c++ skills and play with the cinder framework.
Used 'cinderflow' by @hpeikemo and moved the particles into a 3d world.

(the vector-field is still buggy ..)
